## Reflection
- Create a static single page web application using React.
- It should have a home page and a bit about myself and why I want to be a developer at SovTech.
- The challenge I faced during the development of this app was having to learn a new technology 'React Bootstrap' to produce a working solution, that fits the criteria given to be meet.
- Unexpected errors we dealing with react vulnerabilities and finding up to date learning resources to use.
